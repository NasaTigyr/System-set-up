# System-set-up
This are my files as: 
Nvim config 
.bashrc file


IMPORTANT the .bashrc file will not be visible for you with the ls command. You have to use 'ls -al' to be able to see it. Replace your original .bashrc file. OFcourse, please, First back it up. Then you should have my alias and settings. 

Copy nvim folder to the directory:' ~/.config/ '. 
Restart neovim and run the PlugInstall command.
